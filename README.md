##User Interfaces week one, independent project. 
**A recreation of KEXP Seattle's website. 

##Getting Started
>Clone this repository to your desktop and open the index.html in any browser

##Prerequisites
>A computer with a browser like safari or chrome.

##Things to Know
>This project took me way too many hours. I tried and failed and tried and failed to grasp "outside-in". I deleted and rewrote, and then did it again. I struggled with my limited command of css while also trying to work methodically. I thought I finally had it pretty well when I got to my fifth container, on which I had needed to define a width while I was positioning it with it's sibling in their parent. I should have stopped at the width! I had copied in a bunch of other code from the site I was cloning, and it was not useful. It was in the way. I had to delete it. That is exactly what I need to not do. I think i **finally** learned this. Good Grief, I hope so. I learned a lot of other cool stuff too, about laying out pages and flexbox and using math in sass.
